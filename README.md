### The following components are used:

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The website is styled with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io).
- The navbar is implemented with [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com).
- The CookieConsent component is implemented with [CookieBot](https://github.com/yeutech-lab/react-cookiebot).
- The contact form is implemented with AWS [AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/?nc2=type_a),
  [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=type_a) and [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?nc2=type_a).  
  I used a tutorial for the setup that you can
  find [here](https://dev.to/mtliendo/serverless-contact-form-using-aws-amplify-1e9m).
- The whole website is deployed with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/?nc1=h_ls).
